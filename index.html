          Hi, I am Kavya Datchayani. I am a passionate full-stack web developer.
          I started my journey as a web developer in January 2023. It's been a
          year, and I have learned a lot of things that are essential for
          becoming a full-stack web developer. I started with HTML, CSS,
          Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and
          more. But did I master anything?
        </p>
        <p>
          No, not really. I only learned about 50% of everything in the course I
          enrolled in. It's an online course by <span>Angela Yu</span>, and she
          taught everything quite well. However, after completing every module,
          I was stuck at the end. I was puzzled and confused about everything I
          had learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a lot of thought, I realized that all I had done was follow
          instructions. If I encountered any errors, it wasn't easy to solve
          them on my own. I felt like I needed help, so I decided to take things
          slowly and started working on projects based on the languages I had
          learned. We all need patience in the end to achieve what we really
          want.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Yes, I started coding on my own and encountered many errors. It
          made me learn a lot, and I became pretty good in everything but still
          i sometimes feel like a mess but i know how to find the solution.
          Finding Solution, It's all we need to become Full-Stack Web Developer.
          All I'm saying here is, don't give up quickly. Learn, code, be
          consistent, repeat, and you will succeed.
